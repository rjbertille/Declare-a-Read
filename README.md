# Declare-a-Read
ES6_freeCodeCamp
<p>Change the code so that all variables are declared using <strong>let</strong> or <strong>const</strong></p>
<p>Use <strong>let</strong> when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant.</p>
<p>Also, rename variables declared with <strong>const</strong> to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.</p>
